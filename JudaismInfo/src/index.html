        <h2>What do Jews believe in? </h2>
        <br> 
        <p id="jewBeliefs">Almost all the beliefs of Jews comes from the Hebrew Bible. Of particular significance is the Torah, the name meaning “to teach” or “to point the way.”
            <br>
            In its most limited sense, the word Torah refers to the first five books of the Bible: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. Commonly called the Five Books of Moses, since 
            <br> they are traditionally believed to have been given by God to Moses after the Israelites escaped from Egypt. They relate the early history of Israel and the laws of God.

        <h2>The Ten Commandments</h2>
        
        <p id="tenCommand">According to the Torah, after the Israelites escaped from Egypt, Moses led them to Mount Sinai, where the Jews recieved the Ten Commandments.
            <br>
            These were laws that God had given to the Jews on how to live their life, and the jews pledged themselves to live by God's laws.
            <br>
            
        </p>

        <h2 id="kosherFood">Kosher Food</h2>



        <p>
            There are a list of laws that Jews follow when they eat certain foods. 

            <ol>
                <li>The Torah permits eating only those land animals that chew their cud and have cloven hooves. Four animals, the hare, hyrax, camel, and pig, are specifically identified as being forbidden because they possess only one of the above characteristics: the hare, hyrax and camel are hindgut fermenters and chew their cud but do not have cloven hooves,
                    <br> while the pig has a cloven hoof but does not chew its cud.</li>

                <br>


                <li>The Torah lists winged creatures that may not be consumed, mainly birds of prey, fish-eating water-birds, and bats. Certain domesticated fowl can be eaten,
                    <br> such as chicken, geese, quail, dove, and turkey.</li>

                <br>

                <li>The Torah lists that Jews are not permitted to eat dairy products with meat. 
                    <br>For example, you cannot eat ham and cheese sandwiches if you follow Judaism.</li>

                <br>

                <li>You also cannot eat Gelatin, since it comes from pigs, and Jews do not eat pigs.</li>
            </ol>

        <h2 id="hannukah">Hannukah</h2>

        <br>

        <p>
            Hannukah is a holiday celebrated by Jews.
            <br> Mattathias, a high priest from the village of Modi’in, led a revolt against the rule of Antiochus.
            <br> When Antiochus ordered the Jews to make animal sacrifices and pay homage to Greek gods and pagan idols, Mattathias refused. Antiochus threatened those refusing to abandon their Judaism with the death penalty, 
            and his armies desecrated the Temple in Jerusalem

            <br>
            <br>

            The small army of Jews was led by Mattathias and subsequently by his son Judas Maccabaeus, or Judah Maccabee. The name Maccabee came from the Hebrew word for hammer. The Maccabees regained access to the Temple in Jerusalem after seven years of fighting. 
            <br> In 165 bc the Maccabees purified and rededicated the Temple. 
            <br> The festival of Hanukkah took its name from the Hebrew word for dedication.

        <h2 id="yomKippur">Yom Kippur</h2>

        <p>The most reflective of the Jewish holidays is Yom Kippur, the most religious day of the Jewish year.
            <br>It is a day of fasting and prayer when Jews seek to make amends for their sins and to achieve a adjustment with God
            <br>

            Yom Kippur is observed on the 10th day of the Hebrew calendar month Tishri (in September or October). 

            The purpose of Yom Kippur is to purify the individual and community by the practice of forgiveness of the sins of others and by sincere repentance for one’s own sins against God.
            <br> Jewish congregations spend the eve of Yom Kippur and the entire day in prayer and meditation. They do not work, eat, or drink.

        <h2 id="purim">Purim</h2>

        <br>

        <p> Purim is celebrated among Jews by: Exchanging gifts of food and drink known as mishloach manot. <br> 
            Donating charity to the poor known as mattanot la-evyonim. On Purim, many children dress up in costumes, and it is widely celebrated by Jews.
            <br>

            Purim takes its name from the lots (“purim” in Hebrew) that Haman casts to choose the 13th day of the Jewish calendar month of Adar as the date for the massacre. ... 
            <br> Ahasuerus orders Haman to be hanged, and the Jews attack and kill the enemies preparing to slaughter them

        <h2 id="Passover">Passover</h2>

        <p>
            Passover is a major Jewish holiday that occurs in the spring on the 15th day of the Hebrew month of Nisan. Passover is traditionally celebrated in the 
            <br> Land of Israel for seven days and for eight days among many Jews.
            In the Bible, Passover marks the Exodus of the Children of Israel from Egyptian slavery, when God "passed over" the houses of the Israelites during the last of the ten plagues.

        <h1 class="titleClass" id="originTitle">The Origin of Judaism</h1>
        
        <p>
            According to biblical culture, the roots of the faith can be traced back at least 3,000 years to Abraham, the patriarch who is thought to be the father of Jewish faith, 
            <br> and his descendants who created the nation of Israel.

            <br>
            <br>
            <br>

            <br>

            God commanded him to sacrifice his only son, Isaac, which Abraham reluctantly agreed to do.
            <br> Seeing that Abraham was willing to follow his law, God sent an angel to stay Abraham’s hand.
            <br>  God promised to make the children of Abraham into a great nation and they were to be obedient to God forever.

        <h2 id="exodusInfo">The Exodus</h2>

        <p>
            Long after the time of Abraham, an agricultural crisis led the Israelites to
            <br> move to Egypt, where they were originally made welcome but later turned into slaves. After more than 400 years they were freed from Egyptian bondage under the leadership of Moses <br>and led back to Palestine, or Canaan, as it was called then. This release from Egypt is believed to have taken place about the 13th century bc,
            <br> and the period of the Exodus, as it is called, was an important step in the formation of Judaism.

        <h2 id="jewishTemples">Jewish Temples</h2>

        <p>
            Around 1000 B.C., King David ruled the Jewish people. His son Solomon built the first holy Temple in Jerusalem, which became the central place of worship for Jews.
            <br>
            The kingdom fell apart around 931 B.C., and the Jewish people split into two groups: Israel in the North and Judah in the South.
            <br>
            Sometime around 587 B.C., the Babylonians destroyed the first Temple and sent many Jews into exile.
            <br>
            A second Temple was built in about 516 B.C. but was eventually destroyed by the Romans in 70 A.D.
            <br>
            The destruction of the second Temple was significant because Jewish people no longer had a primary place to gather, so they shifted their focus to worshipping in local synagogues.

        <h2 id="talmud">The Talmud</h2>

        <p>
            Later, the Talmud, a collection of teachings and commentaries on Jewish law, was created. The Talmud contains the Mishnah and another text known as the Gemara (which examines the Mishnah). It includes the interpretations of thousands of rabbis and outlines the importance of 613 commandments of Jewish law.
            <br>
            The first version of the Talmud was finalized around the 3rd century A.D. The second form was completed during the 5th century A.D.
            <br>
            Judaism embraces several other written texts and commentaries. One example is the 13 Articles of Faith, which was written by a Jewish philosopher named Maimonides.

        <h2>The Origin of Religion</h2>


        <p>
            The word religion comes from the Latin word religio, which to the ancient Romans represented all the unknown forces around them that inspired awe and anxiety. 
            <br>Their religion was based on establishing mutual trust between the divine and human in order to secure the benevolence of the gods and their help in mastering those unknown forces.

        </p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <hr>

        <h2>Types of Religion</h2>


        <p>Monotheistic religions like Judaism, Christianity, and Islam are based on the belief in and worship of one, unique God. Virtually all other religions—including Buddhism, Hinduism, Daoism, Shinto,
            <br> most of the indigenous religions of Africa and Oceania, and the religions of Ancient Greece and Rome—have embraced some type of polytheism or the belief in more than one deity. <br> <br>
