        There are a number of rituals and practices in the Catholic Church, such as Mass, Baptism, Confession, Communion, Rosary Prayer, Last Rites, etc. In particular, the Mass is the most important ritual among Catholics, as it is the Supper of their Lord.
        <br><br><br>
        <h1>Christmas</h1>
        <br><br><br>
        <p>
            The four-week period preceding Christmas is designated as Advent by the Catholic Church. It is a period of preparation for a major event where the Lord comes as a King and a Savior. Christmas is not a one-day celebration, according to Catholic tradition, but it is a long festive period that can last up to 22 days. It is also connected to other holidays in the winter period of the year that are celebrated.

        <br><br><br>
        <h1>Baptism</h1>
        <br><br><br>
        <p>
            The one sacrament all Christian denominations share in common is baptism. Babies are baptized in the Catholic Church to welcome them into the Catholic faith and to free them from the original sin with which they were born. The first holy sacrament is followed by baptism: Eucharist, Confirmation, Reconciliation, Anointing of the Sick, Marriage and Holy Orders.

        </p>

        <br><br><br>
        <h1>Confirmation</h1>
        <br><br><br>
        <p>
            The Sacrament of Confirmation, Catholics believe, is the supernatural equivalent of the natural-level growth process. It builds on the beginning of Baptism and the nourishment of the Holy Eucharist. It completes the initiation process into the Christian community, and for the work ahead, it matures the soul.
